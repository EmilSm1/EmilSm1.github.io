                <h2>Play My Game</h2>
                <p>Adventurist is a game about where the main goal is to get to school but it doesn't force you on one single story path. You can go on multiple adventures and 
                    explore multiple different areas of the game. You can purchase items with in-game money and the game isn't p2w. You can play the game at your own pace and
                    there's no unnecessary dialogue.</p>
                <p>Click <a href="NewSchoolProject/SchoolProject/index.html">Here</a> to play.</p>

            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The most important game mechanics in Adventurist are gold and reputation. With gold you can basically do anything as you can buy anything from npcs which will greatly help you
                with gameplay. Reputation also matters too as if you have a low amount of reputation you won't be able to purchase from npcs and you'll be targeted by certain npcs. In the 
                marketplace there's a building and inside that building there's an npc which resets your reputation for gold. You can check your reputation by talking to certain npcs on the map.
